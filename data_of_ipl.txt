Slow over- rate
In this IPL season, matches took longer time to finish due to teams bowling at a slow over-rate. According to the IPL rules, an innings should be completed in 90 minutes, including two 5-minute strategic timeouts, and a complete match should be finished in stipulated 3 hours and 20 minutes. However, as of 5 April 2023, not a single innings had ended in the above-mentioned time frame. Despite penalizing team captains, the over rates have seen little improvement.[54] [55] [56] [57] [58]

English cricketer Jos Buttler appealed on Twitter that the IPL matches should be sped up. Due to the slow over-rates of the various teams, this season's matches finished after 11:30 pm (IST). IPL evening matches are scheduled to start at 7:30 pm and, therefore, should be concluded by 10:50 pm.[59]

Impact player rule
The 2023 season saw the introduction of the impact player rule which allowed for each team to provide a list of 5 players along with the list of their playing 11. Of these 5 designated players, any impact player could then be bought on to feature in the match.[60]

Many cricket pundits criticised the new impact player rule because of the thought that this rule negates the role and involvement of all-rounders in the game.[61][62]
